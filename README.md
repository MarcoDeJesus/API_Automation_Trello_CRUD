# API_Automation_Trello_CRUD
The intention is to show how a CRUD can be implemented with Web API Automation through Java code

In order to get the project running add an Authentication.class file with public constants about Trello APP_KEY and AUTH_TOKEN, as shown below.

public class Authentication{
  public static final String APP_KEY = "YOUR TRELLO DEVELOPERS APPLICATION KEY GOES HERE";
  public static final String AUTH_TOKEN = "YOUR TRELLO AUTHENTICATION TOKEN GOES HERE";
}
